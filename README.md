#  ML08 course

This repository contains all of the assignments that I did in the ML08 course organized by CBD Robotics. It contains 4 Machine Learning and 1 Deep Learning course:

- **Analytic Report:** Analyze movies data collected from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- **Melbourne Housing Market:** Analyze and predict house price in Melbourne, Austria
- **Airline Arrival Delay Cause:** Analyze and classify the lateness of a flight based on flights in America
- **Boston Marathon (unsupervised learning):** Analyze and cluster Boston Marathon's participants based on their running time and living place
- **Fruit Classification:** Train model to classify fruit types

That's all. I have learned so much from this course and my AI journey, especially the importance of natural subjects (Maths, Physics) in high-level engineering.
